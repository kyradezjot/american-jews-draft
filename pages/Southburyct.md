## Southbury, C.T.

On September 25, 1937, Wolfgang Jung purchased 178 acres of land in Southbury, Connecticut for the German-American Bund, intent on building a Nazi camp. The residents of Southbury immediately fought back lead by two local ministers and several local mothers. The camp was going to be named Camp General von Steuben with a capacity for around 1,000 campers. The townspeople were eventually successful in shutting down the camp by the end of the year.
